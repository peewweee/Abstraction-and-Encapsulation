# Abstraction-and-Encapsulation

*These programs show abstraction and encapsulation in object oriented programming.*

**A.) Fan Class**
>- TestFan.py - This is the main program file.
>- fan_class.py - This file contains the class and methods
>- gui_Fan.py - This is where the GUI codes are programmed.

**B.) Car Class**
>- CarObject.py - This is the main program file and where the object was programmed.
>- car_class.py - This file contains the class and methods
>- gui_Car.py - This is where the GUI codes are programmed.

**C.) Pet Class**
>- PetObject.py - This is the main program file and where the object was programmed.
>- pet_class.py - This file contains the class and methods
>- gui_Pet.py - This is where the GUI codes are programmed.

**Try to run and use the program**
>1. With your IDE, run the main program (TestFan.py, CarObject.py, or PetObject.py).
>2. (For TestFan.py) The program will display Fan 1 and Fan 2's speed, radius, color, and ON properties.
>3. (For CarObject.py) The program will display the current speed of the car.
>4. (For PetObject.py) The program will ask the user for inputs. Then, the program will display the inputs of the user.

**The program used:**
>- object oriented programming
